# Post-inference diagnostics

Analyze native errors and score-level signals with explicit reference scope and oracle labeling.

Use `diagnose` when you need to understand the returned alignment, its available scores, and the effect of post-inference oracle comparisons. It returns an in-memory report and performs no refit or file write.

**Post-inference analysis**

```python
report = bp.diagnose(
    result,
    data,
    ks=(1, 5, 10),
    example_limit=10,
    max_dense_entries=25_000_000,
)
print(report["native_output"])
print(report["score_space"])
```

## Available analyses

| Analysis | Question answered | Required information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native error decomposition | Are pairs correct, incorrect within the overlap, or incident to reference-private nodes? | Native pairs and complete matchability labels |
| Directional correspondence | Where does the true counterpart rank, and which shared/private candidates compete with it? | A usable score representation and reference |
| Matchability signals | How informative are maximum scores and top-two gaps about reference matchability? | Score data; both label classes for AUROC/AP |
| Decoder loss | Which highly ranked true pairs are absent from the final native output? | Native pairs and score data |
| Oracle decoding ladder | How do assignments change after revealing source, target, or bilateral reference masks? | Complete reference masks and usable score data |

## Oracle comparisons are analysis-only

The report labels interventions that use reference endpoint masks or thresholds selected from test labels. These are post-hoc comparisons; they do not become native predictions or a deployable calibration rule.

The existing masked comparisons use rectangular Hungarian assignment on the retained score matrix. They are not a common fixed-cardinality intervention, and more endpoint information does not guarantee monotonic Pair F1. The separate true-cardinality oracle is disabled by this public wrapper.

## Missing data and matrix limits

With no usable score matrix or proxy representation, native accounting is still available while `score_space.available` is false with a skip reason. The `max_dense_entries` limit guards dense diagnostic work; it does not alter or reduce a baseline's alignment input.

The legacy score-analysis helper can use supplied similarity scores, negative costs, or a distance representation reconstructed from paired embeddings. Diagnostics do not densify sparse candidate lists into invented complete scores.

## Incomplete labels

For a reference flagged incomplete, the facade returns reference pair accounting and output validity. It explicitly skips private-node decomposition, matchability signals, and reference-mask oracle decoding. See [how to mark incomplete annotations](evaluation.md#section-incomplete-reference).

**Inspect diagnostic availability**

```python
# For incomplete references, inspect the reasons instead of assuming
# every node outside Alignment.json is truly unmatched.
if "skipped_diagnostics" in report:
    print(report["skipped_diagnostics"])
```

## Source-checkout dependency

This wrapper reuses `BPUPGA/baseline261023/evaluation/diagnostics.py` from the sibling research tree. Retain that source when moving the project. If it is absent and full score diagnostics are requested, a `FileNotFoundError` identifies the missing file. The library does not silently substitute another diagnostic implementation.
