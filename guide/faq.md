# Troubleshooting and FAQ

Resolve import, dependency, graph-format, annotation-scope and saved-run questions.

<a name="section-import"></a>

## Python cannot import bpupga

Run the setup from the repository root and add the consolidated `api/` directory to Python's import path:

**Shell**

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/baseline_exdit_261029/api${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}"
python -c "import bpupga; print(bpupga.__file__)"
```

Use the project's existing model environment. This facade is not a PyPI package and depends on the adjacent dated implementation tree. Copying only `api/bpupga/` is insufficient for the built-in methods.

<a name="section-checkout-collision"></a>

## “common is already loaded from another checkout”

Historical baseline trees reuse the top-level import names `baseline`, `baselines`, and `common`. Start a fresh Python process when switching checkouts. Do not mix the historical and current result classes in one session.

<a name="section-dependencies"></a>

## Missing PyTorch, scikit-learn, vendor packages, or weights

The facade wraps existing code rather than replacing its environment. Loading needs NetworkX and NumPy. Evaluation imports the existing metric module and scikit-learn. Built-in execution imports PyTorch and the selected author's dependencies; some models require their existing weights. Diagnostics additionally reuse the sibling legacy evaluation tree. Follow the repository environment instructions rather than installing a guessed universal dependency set.

<a name="section-devices"></a>

## Does device='cpu' mean every implementation is lightweight?

No. It requests the CPU path where the selected implementation supports it; it does not reduce dense matrices, epochs or candidate sets. Device support and memory needs remain method-specific. The facade does not reserve a GPU or attach a new job to the background campaign queue.

<a name="section-graph-input"></a>

## Why does align reject my graph?

Direct graph arguments must be nonempty simple undirected NetworkX graphs, without self loops and with local IDs `0..n-1`. Use `Dataset.load` for file-backed inputs: the loader handles sorted integer ID reindexing and removes self loops. Explicit node lists preserve isolates. Alignment copies topology and discards graph/node/edge attributes.

<a name="section-output-dir"></a>

## Why does construct refuse the output directory?

Every construction writes a new instance. Existing directories and symlinks are refused to protect data provenance. Choose a new destination; there is no public force-overwrite option.

<a name="section-ratios"></a>

## Requested and realized overlap differ slightly

The constructor allocates integer identity groups, so finite-size rounding can alter realized source and target ratios. Read the generated metadata instead of assuming the requested floating-point values were achieved exactly. Node overlap is not an edge-deletion percentage.

<a name="section-reference-completeness"></a>

## What if my correspondences are incomplete?

Record known annotation limitations in metadata. The API retains reference-relative pair/ranking accounting and skips matchability/overlap or private-node analyses that require complete labels. An absent reference link alone does not prove the node is truly unmatched.

<a name="section-missing-ranking"></a>

## Why is ranking None?

A valid pair list does not necessarily provide a continuous ranking over candidates. Read `ranking_policy.skipped_reason`. Do not infer a full ranking from accepted hard pairs or replace missing candidates with fabricated scores.

<a name="section-noninjective"></a>

## Why is Pair F1 present when is_one_to_one is false?

Pair-set recovery and one-to-one feasibility are distinct. Exact duplicates are removed during pair scoring, while repeated endpoints are disclosed. Use the validity report when interpreting native results.

<a name="section-diagnose-missing"></a>

## Diagnostics cannot find diagnostics.py

Retain `BPUPGA/baseline261023/evaluation/` beside the dated project. The public wrapper reuses that inspected diagnostic implementation and reports a missing source file explicitly. It does not rerun a model to reconstruct artifacts.

<a name="section-log-result"></a>

## RunLog has no native_metrics

Only a recorded `SUCCESS` exposes native metrics. Running, failed, and incompatible attempts return `None`; a file lacking native metrics also remains unavailable. Reopen a running attempt later to obtain a fresh snapshot.

<a name="section-training"></a>

## Where are train, checkpoint, resume, and plot_curve?

The current public workflow is `align`, followed by separate evaluation and diagnosis. Method-specific optimization may happen internally. `RunLog` reads saved campaign records; it is not a training logger or a checkpoint manager. These documents describe the implemented interface.

<a name="section-reproduce"></a>

## Will default API calls reproduce the paper tables?

Not automatically. Formal results bind input instances, effective method parameters, seeds, source versions, output variants and resource policies. The convenience API uses adapter defaults unless you supply explicit parameters; it does not silently select the formal campaign's family-specific profiles.

Continue with [installation](installation.md), [quickstart](quickstart.md), or the [API reference](api.md).
